# ITSC1213 Final Project

This project serves as a showcase of what I have learned during the Spring '24 semester of ITSC1213. This project features a text-based space-colony themed resource management game. Although simple, this project showcases a significant portion of what I have learned throughout the semester. The goal of this project was to implement as many concepts learned throughout the class as possible. 

This project will continue to be updated past my completion of ITSC1213. I plan on using this project to practice different concepts and implement different ideas as I learn more about Java and object-oriented programming during my time at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
